function [y]=fconv(x, h)
%FCONV Fast Convolution
%   [y] = FCONV(x, h) convolves x and h, and normalizes the output  
%         to +-1.
%
%      x = input vector
%      h = input vector
% 
%      See also CONV
%
%   NOTES:
%
%   1) I have a short article explaining what a convolution is.  It
%      is available at http://stevem.us/fconv.html.
